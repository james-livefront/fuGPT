# fuGPT: AI-Powered Code Analysis Tool Implementation Status

## Core System Architecture

### 1: Knowledge Base and Repository Processing

[X] Document the canonical solution (code, architecture, patterns)
[X] Create evaluation criteria (what makes a "good" submission) - via questions.txt
[X] Store contextual information in vector database - SQLite + HNSWlib

### 2: GitHub Repository Ingestion Pipeline

[X] Create mechanism to clone repositories from GitHub - vectorize-repo.py
[X] Extract files and directories for processing - os.walk with gitignore support
[X] Handle authentication for private repositories - via git clone

### 3: Parse and Process Repository Content

[X] Extract code files with language detection
[X] Parse content with AST-based processing using tree-sitter
[X] Split content into semantic chunks (functions, classes) for embedding
[X] Preserve file path and structure metadata in SQLite

### 4: Vector Store Implementation

[X] Generate embeddings using OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
[X] Store in dual architecture: SQLite (metadata) + HNSWlib (vectors)
[X] Include metadata about file types, paths, node types, and line numbers
[X] Optimize retrieval settings for code comparison with hybrid search

### 5: RAG Evaluation System

[X] Define evaluation prompts with specific criteria - system-prompt.txt
[X] Build hybrid retrieval system: semantic search + BM25 + cross-encoder reranking
[X] Implement LLM-based evaluator using retrieved context - analyze-repo.py
[X] Design detailed scoring rubric for consistent assessment - questions.txt

### 6: Pipeline Integration

[X] Link repository ingestion to evaluation system
[X] Process candidate repos with AST-based chunking strategy
[X] Generate comprehensive evaluations based on retrieved context
[X] Output structured feedback in markdown format

### 7: Advanced Features Implemented

[X] HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) for query enhancement
[X] Multi-language support (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++)
[X] Modern Python packaging with uv and pyproject.toml
[X] Comprehensive development tooling (ruff, black, mypy, bandit)
[X] Professional documentation and setup scripts

### 8: Development Infrastructure

[X] Create development environment with automated tooling
[X] Implement comprehensive testing framework
[X] Add pre-commit hooks for code quality
[X] Include automated formatting and linting scripts
